"""One tab per open file: what each tab owns, and how the window reaches it.

Several files can be open at once, one shown at a time. A tab is everything the
window used to hold for its one file — the structure as loaded and as shown,
the cell view and supercell, the phonon modes, the undo history, the orbital or
density on screen — together with the widgets that show it: a 3D view of its
own, and its own Phonons, Info, Display, Geometry, Point-symmetry and Plots
panels. Switching tab is then a matter of showing the other tab's widgets; the
camera, the selection, a half-read plot and the display settings of each file
are simply still there, because nothing had to be torn down and rebuilt.

:class:`~crystalline.ui.main_window.MainWindow` keeps reading and writing these
as its own attributes (``self.structure``, ``self._source``, ``self.viewport``,
…): :func:`route_to_active_tab` turns each name listed in :data:`PER_TAB` into a
property that forwards to the tab being shown. So the window's code — two and a
half thousand lines written for one file — acts on "the file on screen" without
knowing there are others.

Qt-only glue: no VTK or crystallography here, so it can be tested alone.
