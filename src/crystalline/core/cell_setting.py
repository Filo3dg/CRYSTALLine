"""Which setting of its space group a cell is written in, and how CRYSTAL names it.

A space-group *type* — number 14, say — can be written in many cells. P2₁/c,
P2₁/n and P2₁/a are one group seen from three choices of axes, and a crystal
computed in P2₁/n has lattice parameters (c = 8.97 Å, β = 105.5°) that its
P2₁/c description does not share (c = 10.43 Å, β = 124.1°). Both are right;
only one of them is the cell the calculation was run in.

The app offers both views, as :data:`COMPUTED` and :data:`STANDARD`:

* **as in the file** — the cell exactly as it is held, in whichever setting of
  its group that cell is. :func:`find_setting` recognises it by asking spglib,
  setting by setting, which one describes the cell with no change of basis.
  (The key is ``"computed"``, from when the app only ever opened CRYSTAL
  output and the cell on screen was always a computed one. A CIF is not, and
  neither is an edited structure, so the label names where the cell came from
  rather than what was done to it.)
* **standard** — pymatgen's conventional standard cell, which is what the app
  used to report everywhere.

Writing either one into a ``.d12`` needs the setting named the way CRYSTAL
reads it (manual, geometry input, record ``IFLAG IFHR IFSO``):

* ``IFLAG = 0`` takes the space-group *number*, which means the standard
  setting of the International Tables; ``IFLAG = 1`` takes the Hermann–Mauguin
  symbol, with a blank between the parts for each symmetry direction, which
  can name a non-standard setting (``P 1 21/N 1``).
* ``IFSO = 0`` puts the origin at the *second* setting of the International
  Tables where a group has two, and ``IFSO = 1`` at the first. Getting this
  wrong is silent and total: silicon written in origin choice 1 and read in
  origin choice 2 has sixteen atoms in the cell instead of eight.
* ``IFHR = 1`` reads a rhombohedral group on rhombohedral axes, ``0`` on
  hexagonal ones.

Nothing is offered on trust: :func:`regenerates` expands the asymmetric unit
with the setting's own operations and checks that the crystal comes back.

Qt-free, like the rest of ``core``.
