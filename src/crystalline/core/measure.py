"""Geometry measurements on a structure: positions, distances, angles, dihedrals.

Measurements are taken on the atoms **as drawn**. The displayed cell is usually
boundary-completed, so an atom that straddles the boundary appears at every cell
position it touches; measuring the drawn coordinates is what the user means when
they click two atoms on screen (VESTA behaves the same way). No minimum-image
convention is applied — pick the image you can see.

Qt-free and free of the renderer, so the maths is unit-tested on its own; the
panel turns a selection into a :class:`Measurement` and the renderer draws it.

A plane through the selection is not a measurement here: it is fitted with the
lattice planes (:func:`crystalline.core.lattice_planes.fit_plane`), listed and
drawn with them.
