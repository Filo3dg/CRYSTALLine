"""Dropping a file on the window: what it is taken for, and when it is acted on.

The window itself can't be built here — a real ``MainWindow`` needs a live
``QtInteractor``, which segfaults under the offscreen platform plugin — so the
handlers under test are bound onto a plain object, which is enough: they only
touch the event, the hint and the two loaders.
